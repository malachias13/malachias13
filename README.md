# Malachias Harris

**`Programmer`**

Hello, I am Malachias Harris and I create software. I enjoy building desktop and console applications. I do occasionally pop open the android studio and see if I can prototype the new app idea my family members have for me. I took some computer graphics and computer networking classes, at my university. I build rasterizers, 3D renderers, and TCP/UDP chat applications.
